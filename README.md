## Architecture

Utilizes a layered architecture to separate concerns and enhance maintainability, mainly following form of Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Below is a description of each layer as represented in the project's directory structure:

- **ChatTailorAI.DataAccess**: This layer is responsible for all database interactions. It includes data models, data access logic, and repositories which facilitate the interaction with the underlying database.

- **ChatTailorAI.Migrations**: Manages database schema migrations, ensuring that changes to the database structure are versioned and applied consistently, facilitating updates and deployment across different environments.

- **ChatTailorAI.Services**: Contains the business logic of the application. This layer processes data retrieved from the DataAccess layer and applies business rules. It acts as a middleman between the presentation and the data persistence layers.

- **ChatTailorAI.Services.Uwp**: Specifically for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications, these handle business logic that might have specific dependencies or requirements unique to UWP.

- **ChatTailorAI.Shared**: This layer serves as a central hub for shared resources, including utilities, constants, common functions, view models, and service interfaces. The view models provide a data structure for the UI elements, encapsulating the presentation logic but without specific business logic implementations. Service interfaces define the contracts for the services which are implemented in the **ChatTailorAI.Services** layer.

- **ChatTailorAI.Uwp**: Represents the presentation layer specifically for UWP. This includes user interface components and the logic needed to handle user interactions within the UWP framework.
